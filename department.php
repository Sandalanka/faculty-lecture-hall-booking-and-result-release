    <center><h1>Welcome to the Faculty of Applied Sciences</h1></center>
    <div class="pp"><p>At the Department of Physical Sciences and Technology, 
        four degree programmes are available for the undergraduates who are keen to accomplish their higher education in the particular fields they wish.</p></div>
    <ul>
        <li>Bachelor of Science (Applied Sciences) Special Degree in Chemical Technology </li>
        <li>Bachelor of Science (Applied Sciences) Special Degree in Computer Science and Technology </li>
        <li>Bachelor of Science (Applied Sciences) Special Degree in Applied Physics </li>
        <li>Bachelor of Science (Applied Sciences) in Physical Sciences </li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>
Mathematics, Statistics, and Management Studies are conducted as supporting tools for the program. 
All theoretical course units conducted by the department are heavily supported by a practical component which provides the preliminary experience to perform confidently.
 And also the Mini projects conducted throughout the third and the fourth academic years stimulate the students' creative and innovative thinking. Final year project (research or industrial training) 
 for one entire semester exposes the undergraduates to the working environment and provides hand on experience in industry before the graduation.</p>
<p>
The Department of Food Science & Technology offers a four year BSc Honours degree program in Food Science & Technology.
Our students get the opportunity to complete a rigorous scientific curriculum that is designed to expand the understanding of the biological, microbiological, chemical, physical, sensory, nutritional, and engineering properties of food/ food commodities and their processing technologies.This includes lectures, lab sessions/practical training, industrial visits/ excursions and a final year research project that can be carried out in a food processing industrial establishment or a research and development institution.
We offer a comprehensive undergraduate program that prepares our graduates well qualified for numerous job opportunities in the food industry, academia, and government.
